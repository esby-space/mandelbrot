# mandelbrot!

![mandelbrot!](images/mandelbrot.png)

## this is my attempt to implement the mandelbrot set using html canvas, it is *really* inefficient!

- written in typescript, under `scripts/main.ts`
- uses html canvas to upload and render
- works best in google chrome, though firefox and safari work too
    - on my machine, it takes about 2 - 5 seconds to load fully

## why?

- bc i here that's what the cs students do
- bc i like math (help me)
- bc its pretty :)
