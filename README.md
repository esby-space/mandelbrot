## this is my attempt to implement the mandelbrot on the web!
**it is *really* inefficient!**

## controls
- press `=` to zoom in
- press `-` to zoom out
- click anywhere to move
- press `0` to reset

## notes
-   written in typescript, under `scripts/main.ts`
-   uses html canvas to upload and render
-   works best in google chrome, though firefox and safari work too

## why?
-   bc i here that's what the cs students do
-   bc i like math (help me)
-   bc its pretty :)
